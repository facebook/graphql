e&#8217;ve had the opportunity to gather lots of feedback regarding our webhook payloads, usage, and integrations.</p> <p>We&#8217;ve listened to the community (check out public issues <a class="external-link" href="https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/7775/post-service-does-not-provide-useful" rel="nofollow">#7775</a>, <a class="external-link" href="https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/5938/include-branch-and-tag-information-for" rel="nofollow">#5938</a>, <a class="external-link" href="https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/4667/add-ability-to-test-services-bb-5436" rel="nofollow">#4467</a>, <a class="external-link" href="https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/6545/pull-request-web-hooks-bb-7736" rel="nofollow">#6545</a> + more) <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="f9afbde2-d7d3-4b5b-86c6-8d23777c85e8">and collaborated with CI</span> vendors to make crucial improvements to this process.</p> <p>W<span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="fc248d98-3e5c-40ba-8a44-b1cc35263435"><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="0509e183-121c-42da-a84a-06b570094e40">e&#8217;re proud</span></span><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="0509e183-121c-42da-a84a-06b570094e40"> to announce</span> the new Bitbucket <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="7388b97c-ceb0-4d5a-83d0-610e323b12e7">webhooks.</span></p> <p><a href="http://blog.bitbucket.org/files/2015/06/webhooks.jpg" rel="lightbox[2499]"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2503" src="http://blog.bitbucket.org/files/2015/06/webhooks-1024x677.jpg" alt="webhooks" width="640" height="423" /></a></p> <p>The new webhooks can be accessed in your repository administration settings as shown in the image above. The webhooks provide a host of improvements over the previous, and soon-to-be deprecated &#8220;POST and Pull Request POST&#8221; hooks, which have now been renamed to &#8220;Services&#8221;.</p> <p>Let&#8217;s look at some of the improvements and attributes of the new webhooks.</p> <h2>Fuller, more descriptive payload<strong><br /> </strong></h2> <p>Bitbucket webhooks now send more comprehensive information in the payload. For example, a <span style="font-family: monospace;">repo:push</span> event now includes detailed payload information about each and every reference that was updated:</p> <p><a href="http://blog.bitbucket.org/files/2015/06/payloads.jpg" rel="lightbox[2499]"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2504" src="http://blog.bitbucket.org/files/2015/06/payloads-1024x425.jpg" alt="payloads" width="640" height="266" /></a></p> <p>Please visit our <a class="external-link" href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Event+Payloads" rel="nofollow">payload documentation</a> for more examples of changes and improvements.</p> <h2>Better controls</h2> <p>We&#8217;ve added fine-grained control over the events you want to receive hooks for, such as repository, issue, and pull request events:</p> <p><a href="http://blog.bitbucket.org/files/2015/06/triggers.jpg" rel="lightbox[2499]"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2511" src="http://blog.bitbucket.org/files/2015/06/triggers.jpg" alt="triggers" width="450" height="224" /></a></p> <h2>Improved troubleshooting</h2> <p>You can now troubleshoot malfunctioning webhooks more easily by reviewing the recent requests, including status codes and response times:</p> <p><a href="http://blog.bitbucket.org/files/2015/06/requests.jpg" rel="lightbox[2499]"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2505" src="http://blog.bitbucket.org/files/2015/06/requests-1024x426.jpg" alt="requests" width="640" height="266" /></a></p> <h2><em>Connect</em>-ed</h2> <p>The new Bitbucket webhooks have been written from the ground up as a Connect add-on using our <a class="external-link" href="https://developer.atlassian.com/static/bitbucket/" rel="nofollow">Atlassian Connect for Bitbucket</a> platform, leveraging the same APIs for building powerful add-ons for extending Bitbucket.</p> <h2>Onward!</h2> <p>This is just the beginning. We&#8217;ve got more features on the way, such as viewing request details (headers, event payloads, etc.), retrying requests, advanced queuing, and much more.</p> <p><em>If you&#8217;re currently integrating with the old webhooks (renamed to &#8220;Services&#8221;), these will be deprecated soon. Please visit our <a class="external-link" href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Event+Payloads" rel="nofollow">payload documentation</a> for the new payload descriptions.</em></p> <p>Take the new Bitbucket webhooks for a spin &#8211; you can configure them in your repository settings.

More than 3 million developers and 450,000 teams use Bitbucket to manage and collaborate on source code. But code collaboration is only a fraction of what software teams do on a daily basis to ship software. Nowadays, shipping great software involves constant context switching using tools that don

’t integrate tightly. Even when integrations are made, toolchains have to be painstakingly maintained on an ongoing basis with reams of messy bespoke integration code that has to be regularly re-written. This is a challenge that development teams face every day. Most integration architectures available right now in the software industry only partially solve the problem. They only provide simple integration points that prevent teams from creating deeper integrations and a more unified workflow. Not your average platform To solve this problem, we’ve re-engineered Bitbucket into a platform that helps remove the interrupt-driven workflow and brings all the information to ship software in one place. Atlassian Connect for Bitbucket provides an integration architecture that embeds your add-ons right within the product UI creating a more unified workflow. Here is a demo of code search enabled by the add-on built by Sourcegraph: &#160; Why build using Atlassian Connect for Bitbucket? If you&#8217;re still wondering why you should build an add-on using Atlassian Connect for Bitbucket, here are three reasons: Atlassian Connect is a next,
