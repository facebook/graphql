RFC: GraphQL Input Union
----------

The addition of an Input Union type has been discussed in the GraphQL community for many years now. The value of this feature has largely been agreed upon, but the implementation has not.

This document attempts to bring together all the various solutions that have been discussed with the goal of reaching a shared understanding of the problem space.

From that shared understanding, this document can then evolve into a proposed solution.

## Problem Statement

GraphQL currently provides polymorphic types that enable schema authors to model complex **Object** types that have multiple shapes while remaining type-safe, but lacks an equivilant capability for **Input** types.

Over the years there have been numerous proposals from the community to add a polymorphic input type. Without such a type, schema authors have resorted to a handful of work-arounds to model their domains. These work-arounds have led to schemas that aren't as expressive as they could be, and schemas where mutations that ideally mirror queries are forced to be modeled differently.

## Problem Sketch

To understand the problem space a little more, we'll sketch out an example that explores a domain from the perspective of a Query and a Mutation. However, it's important to note that the problem is not limited to mutations, since `Input` types are used in field arguments for any GraphQL operation type.

Let's imagine an animal shelter for our example. When querying for a list of the animals, it's easy to see how abstract types are useful - we can get data specific to the type of the animal easily.

```graphql
{
  animalShelter(location: "Portland, OR") {
    animals {
      __typename
      name
      age
      ... on Cat { livesLeft }
      ... on Dog { breed }
      ... on Snake { venom }
    }
  }
}
```

However, when we want to submit data, we can't use an `interface` or `union`, so we must model around that.

One technique commonly used to is a **tagged union** pattern. This essentially boils down to a "wrapper" input that isolates each type into it's own field. The field name takes on the convention of representing the type.

```graphql
mutation {
  logAnimalDropOff(
    location: "Portland, OR"
    animals: [
      {cat: {name: "Buster", age: 3, livesLeft: 7}}
    ]
  )
}
```

Unfortunately, this opens up a set of problems, since the Tagged union input type actually contains many fields, any of which could be submitted.

```graphql
input AnimalDropOff {
  cat: Cat
  dog: Dog
  snake: Snake
}
```

This allows non-sensical mutations to pass GraphQL validation, for example representing an animal that is both a `Cat` and a `Dog`.

```graphql
mutation {
  logAnimalDropOff(
    location: "Portland, OR"
    animals: [
      {
        cat: {name: "Buster", age: 3, livesLeft: 7},
        dog: {name: "Ripple", age: 2, breed: WHIPPET}
      }
    ]
  )
}
```

In addition, relying on this layer of abstraction means that this domain must be modelled differently across input & output. This can put a larger burden on the developer interacting with the schema, both in terms of lines of code and complexity.

```json
// JSON structure returned from a query
{
  "animals": [
    {"__typename": "Cat", "name": "Ruby", "age": 2, "livesLeft": 9}
    {"__typename": "Snake", "name": "Monty", "age": 13, "venom": "POISON"}
  ]
}
```

```json
// JSON structure submitted to a mutation
{
  "animals": [
    {"cat": {"name": "Ruby", "age": 2, "livesLeft": 9}},
    {"snake": {"name": "Monty", "age": 13, "venom": "POISON"}}
  ]
}
```

Another common approach is to provide a unique mutation for every type. A schema employing this technique might have `logCatDropOff`, `logDogDropOff` and `logSnakeDropOff` mutations. This removes the potential for modeling non-sensical situations, but it explodes the number of mutations in a schema, making the schema less accessible.

These workarounds only get worse at scale. Real world GraphQL schemas can have dozens if not hundreds of possible types for a single `Interface` or `Union`.

The goal of the **Input Union** is to bring a polymorphic type to Inputs. This would enable us to model situations where an input may be of different types in a type-safe and elegant manner, like we can with outputs.

```graphql
mutation {
  logAnimalDropOff(
    location: "Portland, OR"
    animals: [
      {name: "Buster", age: 3, livesLeft: 7},
      {name: "Ripple", age: 2, __typename: "Dog"},
    ]
  )
}
```

```graphql
inputunion AnimalDropOff = Dog | Cat | Snake

type Mutation {
  logAnimalDropOff(location: String, animals: [AnimalDropOff]): Boolean
}
```

In this mutation, we encounter the main challenge of the **Input Union** - we need to determine the correct type of the data submitted. In a query, we have the `... on Cat` fragment which explicitly identifies the concrete type of the interface or union.

A wide variety of solutions have been explored by the community, and they are outlined in detail in this document under [Possible Solutions](#Possible-Solutions). In the example above we employed a `__typename` field to indicate the type of animal, but this is only one possible solution.

## Use Cases

TODO:
* [ ] Collect use cases from the community's related Issues / PRs.

## Possible Solutions

Categories:

* Value-based discriminator field
* Structural discrimination

### Value-based discriminator field

These options rely the **value** of a specific input field to express the concrete type.

#### Single `__typename` field; value is the `type`

This solution was discussed in https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/395

```graphql
input AddPostInput {
  title: String!
  body: String!
}
input AddImageInput {
  title: String!
  photo: String!
  caption: String
}

inputUnion AddMediaBlockInput = AddPostInput | AddImageInput

type Mutation {
   addContent(content: AddMediaBlockInput!): Content
}

# Variables:
{
  content: {
    "__typename": "AddPostInput",
    title: "Title",
    body: "body..."
  }
}
```

##### Variations:

* A `default` annotation may be provided, for which specifying the `__typename` is not required. This enables a field migration from an `Input` to an `Input Union`

#### Single user-chosen field; value is the `type`

```graphql
input AddPostInput {
  kind: <AddMediaBlockInput>
  title: String!
  body: String!
}
input AddImageInput {
  kind: <AddMediaBlockInput>
  title: String!
  photo: String!
  caption: String
}

inputUnion AddMediaBlockInput = AddPostInput | AddImageInput

type Mutation {
   addContent(content: AddMediaBlockInput!): Content
}

# Variables:
{
  content: {
    kind: "AddPostInput",
    title: "Title",
    body: "body..."
  }
}
```

##### Problems:

* The discriminator field is non-sensical if the input is used _outside_ of an input union.

#### Single user-chosen field; value is a literal

This solution is derrived from one discussed in https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/488

```graphql
enum MediaType {
  POST
  IMAGE
}
input AddPostInput {
  kind: MediaType::POST
  title: String!
  body: String!
}
input AddImageInput {
  kind: MediaType::IMAGE
  title: String!
  photo: String!
  caption: String
}

inputUnion AddMediaBlockInput = AddPostInput | AddImageInput

type Mutation {
   addContent(content: AddMediaBlockInput!): Content
}

# Variables:
{
  content: {
    kind: "POST",
    title: "Title",
    body: "body..."
  }
}
```

##### Variations:

* Literal strings used instead of an `enum`

```graphql
input AddPostInput {
  kind: 'post'
  title: String!
  body: String!
}
input AddImageInput {
  kind: 'image'
  title: String!
  photo: String!
  caption: String
}
```

##### Problems:

* The discriminator field is redundant if the input is used _outside_ of an input union.

### Structural discrimination

These options rely on the **structure** of the input to determine the concrete type.

#### Order based type matching

The concrete type is the first type in the input union definition that matches.

```graphql
input AddPostInput {
  title: String!
  publishedAt: Int
  body: String
}
input AddImageInput {
  title: String!
  publishedAt: Int
  photo: String
  caption: String
}

inputUnion AddMediaBlockInput = AddPostInput | AddImageInput

type Mutation {
   addContent(content: AddMediaBlockInput!): Content
}

# Variables:
{
  content: {
    title: "Title",
    date: 1558066429
    # AddPostInput
  }
}
{
  content: {
    title: "Title",
    date: 1558066429
    photo: "photo.png"
    # AddImageInput
  }
}
```

#### Structural uniqueness

Schema Rule: Each type in the union must have a unique set of required field names

```graphql
input AddPostInput {
  title: String!
  body: String!
}
input AddImageInput {
  photo: String!
  caption: String
}

inputUnion AddMediaBlockInput = AddPostInput | AddImageInput

type Mutation {
   addContent(content: AddMediaBlockInput!): Content
}

# Variables:
{
  content: {
    title: "Title",
    body: "body..."
    # AddPostInput
  }
}
```

An invalid schema:

```graphql
input AddPostInput {
  title: String!
  body: String!
}
input AddDatedPostInput {
  title: String!
  body: String!
  date: Int
}
input AddImageInput {
  photo: String!
  caption: String
}

inputUnion AddMediaBlockInput = AddPostInput | AddDatedPostInput | AddImageInput

type Mutation {
   addContent(content: AddMediaBlockInput!): Content
}
```

##### Problems:

* Optional fields could prevent determining a unique type

```graphql
input AddPostInput {
  title: String!
  body: String!
  date: Int
}
input AddDatedPostInput {
  title: String!
  body: String!
  date: Int!
}
```

Workaround? : Each type's set of required fields must be uniquely identifying

  - A type's set of required field names must not match the set of another type's required field names
  - A type's set of required field names must not overlap with the set of another type's required or optional field names

Workaround? : Each type must have at least one unique required field

  - A type must contain one required field that is not a field in any other type

##### Variations:

* Consider the field _type_ along with the field _name_ when determining uniqueness.

#### One Of (Tagged Union)

This solution was presented in https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/395#issuecomment-361373097

The type is determined by using an intermediate input type that maps field name to type.

A directive has also been discussed to specify that only one of the fields may be selected. See https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/586.

```graphql
input AddPostInput {
  title: String!
  body: String!
}
input AddImageInput {
  photo: String!
  caption: String
}
input AddMediaBlockInput @oneOf {
  post: AddPostInput
  image: AddImageInput
}

type Mutation {
   addContent(content: AddMediaBlockInput!): Content
}

# Variables:
{
  content: {
    post: {
      title: "Title",
      body: "body..."
    }
  }
}
```
