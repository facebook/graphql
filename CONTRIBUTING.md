# GraphQL Specification Contribution Guide

GraphQL is still an evolving language. This repository contains the
specification text as well as Pull Requests with suggested improvements and
contibutions.

Contributions which do not change the interpretation of the spec but instead
improve legibility, fix editorial errors, clear up ambiguity and improve
examples are encouraged and are often merged by a spec editor with
little process.

However, contributions which do meaningfully change the interpretation of the
spec must follow an RFC (Request For Comments) process led by a *champion*
through a series of *stages* intended to improve *visibility*, allow for
*discussion* to reach the best solution, and arrive at *consensus*. This process
becomes ever more important as GraphQL's community broadens.

When proposing or weighing-in on any issue or pull request, consider the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to better understand expected and
unacceptable behavior.


## Contributing to GraphQL Libraries

A common point of confusion for those who wish to contribute to GraphQL is where
to start. In fact, you may have found yourself here after attempting to make an
improvement to a GraphQL library. Should a new addition be made to the GraphQL
spec first or a GraphQL library first? Admittedly, this can become a bit of a
[chicken-or-egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg) dilemma.

GraphQL libraries seek to be "spec compliant", which means they discourage
changes that cause them to behave differently from the spec as written. However,
they also encourage pull requests for changes that accompany an RFC *proposal*
or RFC *draft*. In fact, a spec contribution RFC won't be *accepted* until it
has experience being implemented in a GraphQL library.

To allow a library to remain spec compliant while also implementing *proposals*
and *drafts*, it may request that these features are built so they are disabled
by default with opt-in option flags or it may simply wait to merge a well-tested
pull request until the spec proposal is *accepted*.


## Guiding Principles

GraphQL's evolution is guided by a few principles. Suggested contributions
should use these principles to guide the details of an RFC and decisions to
move forward. See editor Lee Byron talk about
[guiding principles at GraphQL Europe 2017](https://youtu.be/mePT9MNTM98?t=17m9s).

* **Backwards compatibility**

  Once a query is written, it should always mean the same thing and return the
  same shaped result. Future changes should not change the meaning of existing
  schema or queries or in any other way cause an existing compliant GraphQL
  service to become non-compliant for prior versions of the spec.

* **Performance is a feature**

  GraphQL typically avoids syntax or behaviors which could place burden on
  runtime efficiency or make demands of a GraphQL service it cannot
  efficiently fulfill.

* **Favor no change**

  As GraphQL is implemented in over a dozen languages under the collaboration
  of hundreds of individuals, incorporating any change has a high cost.
  Accordingly, proposed changes must meet a very high bar of added value.
  The burden of proof of value is on the contributor to illustrate this value.

* **Enable new capabilities motivated by real use cases**

  Every change should intend on unlocking a real and reasonable use case. Real
  examples are always more interesting than theoretical ones, and common
  scenarios are more interesting than rare ones. RFCs should do more than offer
  a different way to reach an already achievable outcome.

* **Simplicity and consistency over expressiveness and terseness**

  There are plenty of behaviors and patterns found in other languages
  intentionally absent from GraphQL. "Possible but awkward" is often favored
  over more complex alternatives. Simplicity (e.g. fewer concepts) is
  more important than expressing more sophisticated ideas or writing less.

* **Preserve option value**

  It's hard to know what the future brings, so whenever possible decisions
  should be made which allow for more options in the future. Sometimes this is
  unintuitive: spec rules often begin more strict than necessary with a future
  option to loosen when motivated by a real use case.

* **Understandability is just as important as correctness**

  The GraphQL spec, despite describing technical behavior, is intended to be
  read by people. Use natural tone and include motivation and examples.


## RFC Contribution Champions

Contributing to GraphQL requires a lot of dedicated work. To set clear
expectations and provide accountability, each proposed RFC (request for
comments) must have a *champion* who is responsible for addressing feedback and
completing next steps. An RFC may have multiple *champions*. The spec editors
are not responsible for completing RFCs which lack a *champion* (though an
editor may be a *champion* for an RFC).

An RFC which does not have a *champion* may not progress through stages, and can
become stale. Stale proposals may be picked up by a new *champion* or may
be *rejected*.


## RFC Contribution Stages

RFCs are guided by a *champion* through a series of stages: *strawman*,
*proposal*, *draft*, and *accepted* (or *rejected*), each of which has suggested
entrance criteria and next steps detailed below. RFCs typically advance one
stage at a time, however may advance multiple stages at a time. Stage
advancements typically occur during
[Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg) meetings, however may
occur online.

All RFCs start as either a *strawman* or *proposal*.

## Stage 0: *Strawman*

A RFC at the *strawman* stage captures a described problem or
partially-considered solutions. A *strawman* does not need to meet any entrance
criteria. A *strawman's* goal is prove or disprove a problem and guide
discussion towards rejection or a preferred solution. A *strawman* may be an
issue or a pull request (though an illustrative pull request is preferrable).

*There is no entrance criteria for a Strawman*

As implied by the name [strawman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man_proposal),
the goal at this stage is to knock it down (*reject*) by considering other
possible related solutions, showing that the motivating problem can be solved
with no change to the specification, or that it is not aligned with the
*guiding principles*.

Once determined that the *strawman* is compelling, it should seek the entrance
criteria for *proposal*.


## Stage 1: *Proposal*

An RFC at the *proposal* stage is a solution to a problem with enough fidelity
to be discussed in detail. It must be backed by a willing *champion*.
A *proposal*'s goal is to make a compelling case for acceptance by describing
both the problem and the solution via examples and spec edits. A *proposal*
should be a pull request.

*Entrance criteria:*

* Identified *champion*
* Clear explanation of problem and solution
* Illustrative examples
* Incomplete spec edits
* Identification of potential concerns, challenges, and drawbacks

A *proposal* is subject to the same discussion as a *strawman*: ensuring that it
is well aligned with the *guiding principles*, is a problem worth solving, and
is the preferred solution to that problem. A *champion* is not expected to have
confidence in every detail at this stage and should instead focus on identifying
and resolving issues and edge-cases. To better understand the ramifications of a
*proposal*, a *champion* is encouraged to implement it in a GraphQL library.

Most *proposals* are expected to evolve or change and may be rejected. Therefore,
it is unwise to rely on a *proposal* in a production GraphQL service. GraphQL
libraries *may* implement *proposals*, though are encouraged to not enable the
*proposal* feature without explicit opt-in.


## Stage 2: *Draft*

An RFC at the *draft* stage is a fully formed solution. There is working group
consensus that the problem identified is worth solving, and this particular
solution is preferred. A *draft's* goal is to precisely and completely describe
the solution and resolve any concerns through library implementations. A *draft*
must be a pull request.

*Entrance criteria*

* Consensus the solution is preferred (typically via Working Group)
* Resolution of identified concerns and challenges
* Precisely described with spec edits
* Compliant implementation in GraphQL.js (via unmerged pull request)

A *proposal* becomes a *draft* when the set of problems or drawbacks have been
fully considered and accepted or resolved, and the solution is deemed
desireable. A *draft*'s goal is to complete final spec edits that are ready to
be merged and implement the *draft* in GraphQL libraries along with tests to
gain confidence that the spec text is sufficient.

*Drafts* may continue to evolve and change, occasionally dramatically, and are
not guaranteed to be accepted. Therefore, it is unwise to rely on a *draft* in a
production GraphQL Service. GraphQL libraries *should* implement *drafts* to
provide valuable feedback, though are encouraged not to enable the *draft*
feature without explicit opt-in when possible.


## Stage 3: *Accepted*

An RFC at the *accepted* stage is a completed solution. According to a spec
editor it is ready to be merged as-is into the spec. The RFC is ready to be
deployed in GraphQL libraries. An *accepted* RFC must be implemented
in GraphQL.js.

*Entrace criteria*

* Consensus the solution is complete (via editor or working group)
* Complete spec edits, including examples and prose
* Compliant implementation in GraphQL.js (fully tested and merged)

A *draft* is *accepted* when it has learned via implementation and tests that it
appropriately handles all edge cases, that the spec edits do not only precisely
describe the new syntax and semantics but include motivating prose, examples,
and include edits to any other affected areas of the spec. Once *accepted*, a
*champion* should encourage adoption of the RFC by opening issues or pull
requests on other popular GraphQL libaries.

An *accepted* RFC is merged into the GraphQL spec's master branch by an editor
and will be included in the next released revision.


## Stage X: *Rejected*

An RFC may be *rejected* at any point and for any reason. Most often because a
*strawman* was proven to be unnecessary, was not aligned with the *guiding
principles*, or failed to meet the entrance criteria to become a *proposal*.
A *proposal* may become *rejected* for similar reasons as well as if it fails to
reach consensus or loses the confidence of its *champion*. Likewise a *draft*
may encounter unforseen issues during implementions which cause it to lose
consensus or the confidence of its *champion*.

RFCs which have lost a *champion* will not be *rejected* immediately, but may
become *rejected* if they fail to attract a new *champion*.

Once *rejected*, an RFC will typically not be reconsidered. Reconsideration is
possible if a *champion* believes the original reason for rejection no longer
applies due to new circumstances or new evidence.
