*Working Draft - April 2016*

**简介**

该文档是 GraphQL 的 RFC 标准草案，GraphQL 由 Facebook 在2012年提出，是一种为了描述 Client/Server 架构的应用程序中数据模型的功能和需求的查询语言。标准文档的开发工作始于2015年。GraphQL 是一个很新的，不断在演化的语言，目前还不完善。该标准的后续版本将持续进行改进。

This is a Draft RFC Specification for GraphQL, a query language created by
Facebook in 2012 for describing the capabilities and requirements of data models
for client-server applications. The development of this standard started
in 2015. GraphQL is a new and evolving language and is not complete. Significant
enhancement will continue in future editions of this specification.
